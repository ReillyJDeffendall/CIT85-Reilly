# CIT85-Reilly
Repository for my CIT85 class (Todd's a cool teacher btw)

Hello everyone, I'm Reilly Deffendall. I like to work with computers, play the guitar, and play video games. I plan to learn alot in this class and I will stop at nothing to make sure I get an A.

I've read my fair share of books. I recommend Brave New World by Aldous Huxely.
